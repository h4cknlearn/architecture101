## Introduction to CPU architecture and security

ðŸ’¬ *This repository aims to collect content and multiple materials on CPU's security and exploitation:<br>
mostly on how CPUs work and are designed and security vulnerabilities and attacks raised by its default implementation.*<br>

*CPU architecture and vulnerabilities are one of my main interest subjects.<br>
So I decided to use this repo to gather all info I could about this topic in one place*

*Enjoy! (:*
